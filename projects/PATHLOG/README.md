- Brute force attack detection
- Threat indicator management (IPs, domains, hashes)
- Threat intelligence feed integration

### Security Monitoring
- Cross-platform event correlation
- Custom security rules with conditions and actions
- Risk score calculation
- Real-time alerting

### Incident Response
- Automated incident creation from threats
- Severity-based triage (P1-P4)
- Playbook management and execution
- Mean Time to Detect/Respond/Resolve metrics

### Vulnerability Management
- Code scanning for common vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- API security assessment
- Infrastructure configuration checks
- Remediation tracking with CVSS scores

### Compliance & Audit
- SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS compliance controls
- Tamper-proof audit logging (HMAC signatures)
- Evidence collection and management

## 🔐 Encrypted Memory Features

PathLog also serves as the **personal intelligence archive** for citizens:

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** with key rotation
- Universal memory layer across all AI agents
- End-to-end encryption (zero-knowledge design)
- Searchable encrypted data (client-side)
- Event capture from browser extension and APIs

### How It Works

```
Your Data → Encrypted Analysis → Pattern Detection → Secure Storage
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
   PathLog      Context Tags      Milestone Detection    Recall API
   Capture      Embeddings        Breakthrough Alerts    Search
```
