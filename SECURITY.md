### 1. Privacy as Sacred

All data is treated as a sacred trust:
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Zero-knowledge design** where possible
- **Minimal data collection** — only what's needed
- **User control** — export and delete always available

### 2. PathLog Security

Our security agent protects the ecosystem:
- Real-time threat detection
- Compliance monitoring (SOC2, GDPR)
- Tamper-proof audit logs
- Vulnerability scanning

### 3. Code Security

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code review requirements
- SAST/DAST in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular penetration testing
